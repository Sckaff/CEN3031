# Gator-Rate


-  The ultimate compilation of University of Florida ratings from
    classes to professors. The website is powered by a combination of
    golang and angular and stores data on an mysqlite server. 
    Students can submit ratings through an interactive webpage as well
    as see other student reviews. To verify legitimacy, accounts must be made
    with ufl.edu emails.

- The project is being developed by 4 members consisting of 2 backend and 2 front end developers.

    Brian Nielsen and Christian Scaff are in charge of the frontend whereas
    Fernando Sckaff and Dylan Zhao are in charge of the backend.
